									<h2>Titanic Disaster Prediction (Kaggle Competition)</h2>
									<p>The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

										On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
										
										While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
										
										The goal of the project is to build a model that predicts what kind of people were more likely to survive.</p>

									<h2>Drug Selection for Patients using Machine Learning</h2>
									<p>Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.

										Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.</p>

									<h2>BikeShare Cyclist Analysis with R programming </h2>
									<p>BikeShare Cyclist a fictional bike transportation company based in Chicago, Illinois is faced with the issue of converting casual bike riders into members. I received a data set which includes members and casual riders transport details for four quarters in the year 2019, with the data provided I was able to perform operations like cleaning, manipulation, analysis and visualization all in R stuido and came up with a recommended solution to the issue they were faced with. This is a perfect example of using data to drive decision-making.</p>

									<h2>Olympic Games Gender Balance Analysis with R programming</h2>
									<p>The Olympic Games being one of the biggest and most participated events in the world for athletes, started out not allowing women to watch the games not to even talk of participating in them. So with the help of data I have taken from Kaggle, I have been able to run a descriptive analysis on women's participation at the Olympic Games over the years, I have cleaned data, analyzed data, and used that data to create charts which has led me to believe that the Olympic Games is becoming or if not already is a Gender-Balanced Event.</p>
